# Contrastech_python_SDK
a very (very) basic working version of a python SDK for Contrastech MARS model USB 3.0 cameras.
I own a couple of Contrastech MARS cameras http://www.contrastech.com/content/?875.html
and have had to use 3rd party SDK's to get windows functionality for these cameras in Python. 
Let me be thje first to say that the one I have used has been very good for what I need, but other than Aravis, I have 
not been able to find anything that worksd for Linux for Python that allows grabbing of images in an numpy nd.array style image grab.
Contrastech was good enough to provide an example of some code that grabbed images and saved them as a BMP.  This code I have written is
very basic, but allows grabbing of an numpy nd.array style image.
It should be noted that I have fumbled my way to this point to get some working code - I do not profess to be an expert.  My reason for
adding this repo is in the hope that some thgat others may be able to benefit from it as well as contribute to a better version of the
code.

In closing, if you own one of these cameras and work in Linux and can use this code, then please do so.  Also, please contribute anything you feel to be of benefit.
